The available functions are book_table, get_table_status, and get_menu_details.\n\nFirst, \"1 lunch\" could be interpreted in a few ways. Maybe they want to book a table for lunch, or check the status of table 1, or ask about the menu. Let me break it down. The number \"1\" might refer to a table number, like checking the status of table 1. But the phrase \"lunch\" could also be the time, like booking a table for lunchtime. However, the user didn't specify a date, time, or number of people. \n\nLooking at the functions, book_table requires date, time, restaurant_location, and number_of_people. The input here doesn't have enough details. The get_table_status needs table_id and restaurant_location. The user mentioned \"1\" which could be the table ID, but there's no location specified. The get_menu_details doesn't require any parameters. \n\nSince the user is asking about a table status but only provided the table ID as \"1\" without a location, maybe they're trying to check the status of table 1. But the restaurant_location is missing. Alternatively, if they're trying to book a table, \"1 lunch\" might be the number of people and the meal time, but that's a stretch. The phrase \"1 lunch\" is a bit ambiguous. \n\nWait, the example given for get_table_status was \"What's the status of table 12?\" which had the table_id as 12 and restaurant_location as null. So in this case, if the user says \"1 lunch\", maybe they're referring to table 1 and the meal time is lunch. But the function get_table_status requires restaurant_location. Since it's not provided, the arguments would have table_id as \"1\" and restaurant_location as null. However, the user might not be asking about the table status but rather the menu. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"1 lunch\" is a way to say \"I want to book a table for lunch, 1 person\". But the function book_table needs date, time, location, and number of people. The user hasn't provided date or time, so those would be null. But the input is too vague. \n\nSince the user hasn't specified any of the required parameters for book_table, and the get_table_status requires location, which is missing, the most likely function here is get_menu_details. Wait, but the user didn't mention the menu. They just said \"1 lunch\". Maybe they're asking about the menu for lunch? But the function get_menu_details doesn't take parameters. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is trying to book a table for lunch, but only provided the number of people as 1. But the other parameters like date, time, and location are missing. So the function would be book_table with number_of_people as 1 and others as null. However, the input is \"1 lunch\" which could be interpreted as the number of people and the meal time. But the function book_table requires date and time. \n\nHmm, the user might be trying to book a table for lunch, but the date and time aren't specified. So the function would be book_table with number_of_people as 1, time as \"lunch\", and date and location as null. But is \"lunch\" considered a time? The function's parameters accept flexible time formats, so maybe that's acceptable. \n\nWait, but the example for book_table had \"tomorrow\" as date and \"7pm\" as time. So \"lunch\" could be the time. However, the user didn't mention a date. So the date would be null. \n\nBut the problem is that the user's input is very short. It's possible they meant to check the status of table 1, but without the location, that's not possible. Alternatively, they might be asking for the menu, but the input doesn't mention that. \n\nSince the user's input is ambiguous and doesn't provide enough parameters for any of the functions, maybe the correct response is to set the function to null. But wait, the example for get_table_status had a missing location. However, in that case, the function was still called with table_id and location as null. \n\nSo, if the user says \"1 lunch\", perhaps they are referring to table 1 and the meal time is lunch. But the function get_table_status requires restaurant_location. Since it's not provided, the arguments would have table_id as \"1\" and restaurant_location as null.

The user is asking about a date for booking a table, so it's probably the book_table function. The parameters for book_table include date, time, restaurant_location, and number_of_people. \n\nBut the current function we're focusing on is get_menu_details, which only requires restaurant_location. However, the user's question is about booking a date, which might be part of the book_table function. Wait, the initial setup says the missing parameter is restaurant_location for get_menu_details. But the user's input is about booking a date, which is part of book_table. \n\nWait, maybe there's confusion here. The user's input is asking for the date to book a table, which would be part of the book_table function. But the current function we're supposed to extract parameters for is get_menu_details. However, the user hasn't provided any information about the restaurant location yet. The existing missing parameter is restaurant_location for get_menu_details. \n\nBut the user's question is about booking a date, not about the menu. So maybe the user is trying to book a table, but the system is currently looking for the restaurant location. However, the user hasn't provided that. The input is asking for the date, which is a parameter for book_table. But the current function's missing parameter is restaurant_location. \n\nWait, the initial setup says that the current function is get_menu_details, which requires restaurant_location. But the user is asking about booking a date, which is unrelated. So perhaps the user is trying to use the book_table function but the system is in the process of collecting parameters for get_menu_details. \n\nBut according to the rules, I should only extract parameters for the missing parameters of the current function. The current function is get_menu_details, which is missing restaurant_location. The user's input is asking for the date, which is not related to get_menu_details. Therefore, there's no parameter to extract here. \n\nWait, but the user's input is about booking a date, which is part of book_table. However, the current function is get_menu_details. So maybe the user is switching context. But according to the rules"

But the current function specified is get_menu_details, which is a bit confusing. Wait, the user is talking about a table booking confirmation, so maybe the initial function was get_menu_details, but the user's message is about booking a table. Hmm, maybe there's a mix-up here.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the current function is get_menu_details, and the missing parameter is restaurant_location. However, the user's input is about a table booking, which relates to the book_table function. But the task is to extract parameters for the current function, which is get_menu_details. Wait, maybe the user is confirming a booking, but the function we need to use is get_menu_details. That doesn't seem right. Let me check the available functions again.\n\nAvailable functions are book_table, get_table_status, and get_menu_details. The user's message is about a table being booked, so maybe the function should be book_table. But the current function listed is get_menu_details, which is missing restaurant_location. However, the user's input doesn't mention anything about the menu. They're talking about booking a table, so perhaps the correct function is book_table. But the problem says the current function is get_menu_details. Maybe there's a mistake here, but I have to follow the given setup.\n\nWait, the user's input is a confirmation message, not a request to book a table. The user is informing that a table was booked. So maybe the function is not book_table but get_table_status? But the user hasn't provided a table ID. Alternatively, maybe the user is just confirming the booking, and the parameters needed for get_menu_details are not present. But the user's message includes \"Delhi\" which is a location. The missing parameter for get_menu_details is restaurant_location. So the user mentioned \"Delhi\" as the location. So the arguments should be {\"restaurant_location\": \"Delhi\"}.\n\nBut the user also mentions \"Today at 8 pm for 3 people.\" However, those parameters (date, time, number_of_people) are for the book_table function,",
